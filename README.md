# A Consensus Protocol for Distributed Object State

This project provides an implementation of our automatic program transformation for converting local applications to distributed ones using the replica model. Internally, it uses Paxos for consensus and achieves (n/2-1)-fault tolerance in the general omission model. The library can be built on any platform that supports Java 8, with a JRE, a JDK, and `make` installed. To build the project, use the command `make all`.
